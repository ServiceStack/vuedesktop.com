We can see a glimpse of this in action by viewing .dll&#39;s being loaded in the JS Debug Inspector:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/app/vue-desktop/blazor-jsdebug.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="disadvantages-of-blazor" tabindex="-1">Disadvantages of Blazor <a class="header-anchor" href="#disadvantages-of-blazor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The main value proposition of Blazor appears to be running C# in the browser, which while a technically impressive feat, requires a tonne of complexity to achieve that results in worse end-user UX. It works using a development model based on Razor - a technology <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/why-not-razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we&#39;re not fond of</a> due to its reliance on heavy/complicated tooling and should be noted that historically whenever .NET invented their own development model for the Web in <a href="http://ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET</a> Web Forms or Silverlight, they&#39;ve ended up being abandoned.</p><p>Another reason we&#39;re not fond of technologies like Blazor is from experience in having to support &quot;crippled&quot; .NET Runtimes on platforms where only a subset of functionality of .NET is available, where we&#39;ve lost untold time &amp; effort trying to diagnose &amp; track down runtime issues in Windows Phone, Silverlight &amp; Xamarin iOS due to platform restrictions (<a href="https://forums.servicestack.net/t/possible-to-allow-setting-of-usecookies-property-in-jsonhttpclient/8618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we&#39;re already seeing</a> reported in Blazor), differing implementation behavior or .NET libraries heavy use of reflection that&#39;s problematic in AOT environments.</p><p>Even without the drawbacks, going against the momentum of established Web UI Technologies like <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>, their vibrant communities &amp; <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome ecosystems</a> in favor of an uncertain foreign development model reliant on heavy/complex tooling that only a single vendor can provide serving only a single language ecosystem just to be able to use C# in the browser isn&#39;t a desirable goal as modern JS/TypeScript offer a more productive &amp; enjoyable Reactive UI development model than any C#/XAML UI Framework we&#39;ve used.</p><p>Ultimately as <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/service-complexity-and-dto-roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staunch enemy&#39;s of complexity</a> we&#39;re philosophically against reliance on heavy complicated tooling and instead have adopted a Vue Chromium Desktop approach for the development of <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceStack Studio</a> - an App that <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.9#highly-productive-live-reloading-development-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wouldn&#39;t have been feasible</a> if needing to use any C# &amp; XAML UI FX or WinForms historically used to develop .NET Desktop Apps.</p><h3 id="blazor-wasm-starting-project-template" tabindex="-1">Blazor WASM Starting Project Template <a class="header-anchor" href="#blazor-wasm-starting-project-template" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>But as it&#39;s the latest technology developed &amp; promoted by .NET PR it&#39;s going to be the Web UI technology compared to most, so this project template is based on the UI of an empty Blazor WASM project, rewritten to use Vue SPA UI &amp; a back-end .NET Core App. It&#39;s an enhanced version that also includes examples of commonly useful features:</p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-desktop/blob/master/src/components/Home.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home page</a> includes example of using <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/typescript-add-servicestack-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript Service Reference</a> to consume typed APIs</li><li><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-desktop/blob/master/src/components/FetchData.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fetch data page</a> sources it&#39;s data from an embedded SQLite database querying an <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-rdbms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoQuery Service</a></li><li>Utilizes <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in SVG support</a> for using Material Design &amp; Custom SVG Icons</li><li>Utilizes <a href="https://sharpscript.net/sharp-apps/win32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Win 32 Integration</a> showcasing how to call Win32 APIs from the UI</li></ol><h4 id="distributed-app-size" tabindex="-1">Distributed App Size <a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-app-size" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>The first comparison is a direct result of the approaches used in each technology, where in addition to all your App&#39;s assets Blazor WASM has to also bundle a dotnet WASM runtime &amp; linked/tree-shaken .dll&#39;s. Whilst <code>app</code> Desktop Apps is on opposite side of the spectrum where it only requires distribution of <strong>App-specific functionality</strong> as all popular Vue JS libraries, Bootstrap CSS, Material Design SVG icons or ServiceStack .dll&#39;s used are pre-bundled with the global <code>app</code> dotnet tool.</p><p>For the comparison we ran the <code>publish-app</code> script &amp; Blazor&#39;s <strong>Publish to Folder</strong> tool &amp; compared the <strong>.zip</strong> of each folder which resulted in:</p><h4 id="_15kb-vue-desktop-app-vs-6207kb-blazor-wasm-413x-smaller" tabindex="-1"><code>15kb</code> Vue Desktop App vs <code>6207kb</code> Blazor WASM (413x smaller) <a class="header-anchor" href="#_15kb-vue-desktop-app-vs-6207kb-blazor-wasm-413x-smaller" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>The end result that even our <strong>enhanced</strong> Blazor WASM starting project template is <strong>413.8x</strong> or <strong>2.6x</strong> orders of magnitude smaller than Blazor WASM.
